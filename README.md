# Markov Chain Text Generator

### Internship Task 03 â€“ Prodigy Infotech (Generative AI Domain)

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of **Text Generation** using **Markov Chains** in Python. The model learns word-to-word transitions from a given input text and generates new, coherent sentences based on probabilistic word selection.

---

### Sample Input Text (Nature-Themed)
> "The sun sets over the mountains. Birds return to their nests. The forest becomes quiet. A cool breeze flows through the trees. Night slowly takes over the sky."

---

### How It Works
1. **Text Processing:** Splits the input text into words.
2. **Markov Chain Construction:** Builds a dictionary mapping each word to possible next words.
3. **Text Generation:** Starts with a given word and randomly selects the next word based on learned probabilities.

### Sample Output

```
The forest becomes quiet. A cool breeze flows through the trees. Night slowly takes...
```

*Each run generates different output due to randomness.*

### Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

### How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the `.ipynb` / `.py` file  
2. Run in Google Colab or any Python IDE  
3. Modify the `sample_text` if you'd like to train it on different data  
4. Run and enjoy the generated sentences!
